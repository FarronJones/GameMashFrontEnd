        <h3>How to Play:</h3>
        <h4>In Game Mash, you take control of two quirky characters, each with their own unique powers and abilities. 
            Imagine one being a delicious burger, ready to flip and sizzle, while the other could be anything from a quirky sidekick to an unpredictable element with special skills!
            Your goal is to work together, using the strengths of each character to overcome challenges, solve puzzles, and defeat any obstacles in your path. Whether itâ€™s using the burger's tasty moves or the special abilities of the second character, teamwork and strategy are key to success!</h4>
